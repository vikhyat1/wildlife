<P ALIGN="JUSTUFY"><PRE> Wildlife are animals that have not been domesticated by humans.
 This does not mean that wild animals live without human interference. Humans control, manage, manipulate, use, and kill wildlife for various
 reasons.Humans tend to think of wild animals in terms of the threat they pose to people or the value they hold for them.<BR>
 Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.
 Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms 
 of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human
 activities.</PRE>

<A NAME="Importance of wildlife"><FONT SIZE=6 FACE="LUCIDA HANDWRITING"><center>IMPORATNCE OF WILDLIFE</center></FONT><PRE>
   Wildlife is important in following aspects:

<font size=3>               <B>Biodiversity</B></font>
                           Biodiversity is one important issue. Reduction in numbers of one animal interrupts the eco system and the natural food chain,
                           and leads to the threat of other species.

<font size=3>               <B>Release suffering</B></font>
                           Animal conservation can be important to relieve suffering for animals because they are kept captive.
                           Examples of this is the use of elephants in South East Asia for tourism. Likewise, the use of orangutans in Indonesia for boxing shows. 
                           In addition to the suffering cause to the animals, these activities create sharp population decline for the species.

 <font size=3>              <B>Human needs</B></font>
                           Reduction in numbers of one animal can also have a chain effect on other species that are important to human beings.
                           All animals play an important role in the eco system. The loss or reduction of certain species can have a flow on effect;
                           including an affect on human food and water source that are critical to our survival

 <font size=3>              <b>Water and air</b></font>
                            Keeping the eco system in balance helps providing with clean air and clean water that we all benefit from, people and animals.

<A NAME="Conservation">
<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="LUCIDA HANDWRITING"><center>WILDLIFE CONSESRVATION</center></FONT>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to prevent species from going extinct and to preserve natural Ecosystems. 
 Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction/degradation/fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution and climate change. The IUCN estimates that 27,000 species
 of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction. Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species. It's also 
 being acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and
 international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife. Prominent conservation agreements include the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
 Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).[1][2] There are also numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) dedicated to conservation
 such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International.</P>
